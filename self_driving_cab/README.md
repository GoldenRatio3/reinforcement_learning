# Self Driving Cab

This program trains and compares to agents
 1. Random selection agent
 2. Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning Agent

## Improvements
 - Turn this code into modules of functions that can use multiple environments
 - tune alpha, gamma, and epsilon using decay over episodes
 - hyperparameter tuning through grid search then genetic algorithms
 - Create third agent deep RL agent
  - neural net to take in state information and actions to the input layer -> action to the output layer
